# wedding-photo-album

This wedding album is part of a wedding site, where the users could also RSVP.

Both projects were in AWS, with the Angular application being in S3, Cloudfront, and Route53.
For handling the RSVP I created an endpoint with API Gateway and used the SES to send emails to the wedding manager with the answer.
